# Image-Audio Encryption-Decryption System

A system that converts audio to image and visa versa. Used two algorithms for this : 
(1) Lossy: Losses data but requires less space. Compressed the data to 18% of original size.<br>
(2) Lossless: Retains all original data but requires more space than lossy. Compressed data to 72.2% of original size.

The system can send encrypted audio files ( that are generated by merging the image from original audio along with another image). This is sent along with this other image that holds the key to decryption of this audio file and hence, the original audio can be recovered.
